Darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School|University of Edinburgh]]; instead, he helped to investigate [[marine invertebrates]]. His studies at the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] from 1828 to 1831 encouraged his passion for [[natural science]].<ref name="Leff 2000">{{Harvnb|Leff|2000|loc=[https://web.archive.org/web/20130723181529/http://www.aboutdarwin.com/darwin/WhoWas.html About Charles Darwin]}}.</ref> However, it was his [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|five-year voyage]] on {{HMS|Beagle}} from 1831 to 1836 that truly established Darwin as an eminent geologist. The observations and theories he developed during his voyage supported [[Charles Lyell]]'s [[uniformitarian|concept of gradual geological change]]. Publication of his [[The Voyage of the Beagle|journal of the voyage]] made Darwin famous as a popular author.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=210, 284–285}}.</ref>

Puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and, in 1838, devised his theory of natural selection.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=263–274}}.</ref> Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research, and his geological work had priority.<ref>{{harvnb|van Wyhe|2007|pp=184, 187}}</ref> He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting the immediate joint submission of [[On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection|both their theories]] to the [[Linnean Society of London]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1=Beddall | first1=B.

His research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, [[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms|''The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Actions of Worms'']] (1881), he examined [[earthworm]]s and their effect on soil.

Darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Why Evolution is True |last=Coyne |first=Jerry A. |author-link=Jerry Coyne |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-923084-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780199230846/page/17 17] |quote=In ''The Origin'', Darwin provided an alternative hypothesis for the development, diversification, and design of life.

===Early life and education===

Darwin was born in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, on 12 February 1809, at his family's home, [[The Mount, Shrewsbury|The Mount]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Desmond |first=Adrian J. |title=Charles Darwin |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |date=13 September 2002 |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin |access-date=11 February 2018 |archive-date=6 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206114419/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://darwin.baruch.cuny.edu/biography/shrewsbury/mount/ |title=The Mount House, Shrewsbury, England (Charles Darwin) |author=John H.

His grandfathers [[Erasmus Darwin]] and [[Josiah Wedgwood]] were both prominent [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]]. Erasmus Darwin had praised general concepts of evolution and [[common descent]] in his ''[[Zoonomia]]'' (1794), a poetic fantasy of gradual creation including undeveloped ideas anticipating concepts his grandson expanded.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Homer W. |url=https://archive.org/details/manhisgods00smit |title=Man and His Gods |date=1952 |publisher=[[Grosset & Dunlap]] |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/manhisgods00smit/page/339 339–340] |author-link=Homer W.

Both families were largely [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], though the Wedgwoods were adopting [[Anglicanism]]. Robert Darwin, a [[Freethought#United Kingdom|freethinker]], had baby Charles [[baptism|baptised]] in November 1809 in the Anglican [[St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury]], but Charles and his siblings attended the [[Shrewsbury Unitarian Church|local Unitarian Church]] with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]] in attending the nearby Anglican [[Shrewsbury School]] as a [[boarding school|boarder]].<ref name="Desmond-3">{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=12–15}};<br />{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=21 21–25]}}.</ref>

Darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of Shropshire, before going to the well-regarded [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]] with his brother Erasmus in October 1825. Darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies.{{sfn|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=48 46–48]}} He learned [[taxidermy]] in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from [[John Edmonstone]], a freed black slave who had accompanied [[Charles Waterton]] in the South American [[rainforest]].<ref name="Darwin 1958-6">{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=53 51]}};<br />{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VTNIBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA18 18–26]}}.</ref>

In Darwin's second year at the university, he joined the [[Plinian Society]], a student [[natural history|natural-history]] group featuring lively debates in which [[radicalism (historical)#Popular agitation|radical democratic]] students with [[materialism|materialistic]] views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=31–34}} He assisted [[Robert Edmond Grant]]'s investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of [[marine invertebrates]] in the [[Firth of Forth]], and on 27 March 1827 presented at the Plinian his own discovery that black spores found in [[oyster]] shells were the eggs of a skate [[leech]]. One day, Grant praised [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck]]'s [[Lamarckism|evolutionary ideas]]. Darwin was astonished by Grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather Erasmus' journals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=72–88}}.</ref> Darwin was rather bored by [[Robert Jameson]]'s natural-history course, which covered geology{{snd}}including the debate between [[neptunism]] and [[plutonism]]. He learned the [[alpha taxonomy|classification]] of plants and assisted with work on the collections of the [[Royal Museum|University Museum]], one of the largest museums in Europe at the time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=42–43}}.</ref>

Darwin's neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who sent him to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], in January 1828, to study for a Bachelor of Arts degree as the first step towards becoming an Anglican country [[parson]]. Darwin was unqualified for Cambridge's ''[[Tripos]]'' exams and was required instead to join the ordinary degree course.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|pp=47–48, 89–91}};<br />{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|2009|pp=47–48}}.</ref> He preferred [[equestrianism|riding]] and [[shooting sports|shooting]] to studying.{{sfn|Darwin|1887|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=66&itemID=F1452.1&viewtype=text 48]}}

During the first few months of Darwin's enrolment at Christ's College, his second cousin [[William Darwin Fox]] was still studying there.

Through Fox, Darwin became a close friend and follower of botany professor [[John Stevens Henslow]].<ref name="Smith-1952" /> He met other leading [[parson-naturalist]]s who saw scientific work as religious [[natural theology]], becoming known to these [[University don|dons]] as "the man who walks with Henslow". When his own exams drew near, Darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of [[William Paley]]'s ''Evidences of Christianity'' (1795).<ref name="Desmond">{{Harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|pp=73–79, 763}};<br />{{Harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F1497&pageseq=59 57–67]}}.</ref> In his final examination in January 1831, Darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ''ordinary'' degree.<ref>{{Harvnb|Browne|1995|p=97}}.</ref>

Darwin had to stay at Cambridge until June 1831. He studied Paley's ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' (first published in 1802), which made an [[teleological argument|argument for divine design in nature]], explaining [[adaptation]] as God acting through [[Physical law|laws of nature]].<ref name="von Sydow 2005">{{Harvnb|von Sydow|2005|pp=5–7}}.</ref> He read [[John Herschel]]'s new book, ''Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy'' (1831), which described the highest aim of [[natural philosophy]] as understanding such laws through [[inductive reasoning]] based on observation, and [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Personal Narrative'' of scientific travels in 1799–1804.<ref>{{ cite book | last=Daum | first=Andreas W.|author-link=Andreas Daum | year=2024 | title=Alexander von Humboldt: A Concise Biography | location=Trans.
